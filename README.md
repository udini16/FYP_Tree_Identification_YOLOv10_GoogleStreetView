🌳 Tree Scanner: Malaysian Urban Canopy Analysis🧭 Project OverviewThe Tree Scanner project is an application designed to automatically detect and classify common Malaysian street trees using Computer Vision on Google Street View images.This project utilizes the YOLOv10 object detection model, trained on a custom dataset of urban trees (Angsana, Rain Tree, Coconut Palm, Royal Palm). The application allows users to navigate the streets, capture the current view, run the trained model on the image, and log the inventory of detected trees.Key Features🌐 Google Street View Integration: Interactive map/panorama for real-world testing.🧠 YOLOv10 Detection: Fast and accurate detection of specific tree species in urban environments.💾 Server-Side Logging: Automatically logs all scan results (coordinates, time, tree counts) to a persistent CSV file (treeInventory.csv).📊 Live Inventory Table: Displays all historical scan data directly on the web interface.📥 CSV Export: Allows users to download the complete treeInventory.csv for further analysis.🛠️ Technology StackComponentTechnologyPurposeBackend FrameworkDjangoHandles routing, API endpoints, and server-side processing.Computer VisionYOLOv10 (Ultralytics)The core object detection model for tree classification.Image SourceGoogle Street View Static APIFetches the street images for scanning.Database/StorageCSV FilesUsed for logging tree inventory data (treeInventory.csv).FrontendHTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, JavaScriptInteractive interface and display of results.
